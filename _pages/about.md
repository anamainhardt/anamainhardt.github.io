I am Ana Maria, a fifth-year PhD candidate at the
[Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org), Kaiserslautern, Germany,
where I work under the supervision of [Anne-Kathrin Schmuck](https://wp.mpi-sws.org/akschmuck/) in the [Control Software Systems group](https://cossy.mpi-sws.org).

I studied Control and Automation Engineering
at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianópolis, Brazil.
From the same university, I received my Master’s degree in
Automation Systems Engineering.

## My research
My ongoing research lies in the field of Supervisory Control of Discrete Events Systems (DES).
I have developed a method for synthesising decentralised supervisors
that respects the private behaviour of individual distributed processes,
which is achieved via negotiation of assume-guarantee contracts.
Beyond safety and privacy, I am also interested in security aspects of DES and their resilience to attacks. 

More broadly, my interests include other areas of Formal Methods and Control Systems, especially DES, and extend to Systems Biology, particularly gene regulatory networks, which I have explored during my Master's studies.

## Awards
* Best Student Paper Award at the 16th IFAC Workshop on Discrete Event Systems (WODES’22)

## Recorded Talks
* Invited talk at the PhD Forum for the [Virtual Talk Series on Discrete Event Systems 2023](https://ieeecss.org/tc/discrete-event-systems/talk-series-2023), organised by IEEE CSS TC DES

## And a bit more about me...
I am a vegan enthusiast who adores cats. My favorite trips are in nature, especially backpacking and bikepacking, but I also love exploring cities for their food and visual arts. :)
