I am Ana Maria, a 3rd-year PhD candidate at the
[Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org), Kaiserslautern, Germany.
I am advised by [Anne-Kathrin Schmuck](https://wp.mpi-sws.org/akschmuck/), in the [Control Software Systems group](https://cossy.mpi-sws.org).

I studied Control and Automation Engineering
at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianópolis, Brazil.
From the same university, I received my Master’s degree in
Automation Systems Engineering.

My ongoing research lies in the field of Supervisory Control Theory, 
but my interests include Formal Verification and Systems Biology.

I am a vegan who adores cats, loves hiking and biking, nature, and visual arts. :)
